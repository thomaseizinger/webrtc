use std::task::{Context, Waker};

/// Helper for waking unpredictable numbers of tasks simultaneously
///
/// # Rationale
///
/// Sometimes we want to let an arbitrary number of tasks wait for the same transient condition. If
/// a task is polled and finds that the condition of interest is not in effect, it must register a
/// `Waker` to arrange to be polled when that may have changed. The number of such tasks is
/// indefinite, so we collect multiple `Waker`s in a `Vec` to be triggered en masse when the
/// condition arises.
///
/// Complication arises from the spurious polling expected by futures. If each interested task
/// blindly registered a new `Waker` on finding the condition not in effect, the `Vec` would grow
/// with proportion to the (unbounded) number of spurious wakeups that interested tasks undergo. To
/// resolve this, we increment a generation counter every time we drain the `Vec`, and associate
/// with each interested task the generation at which it last registered. If a spurious wakeup
/// occurs, the task's generation is current, and we can avoid growing the `Vec`. If, however, the
/// wakeup is genuine but the condition of interest has already passed, then the task's generation
/// no longer matches the counter, and we infer that the task's `Waker` is no longer stored and a
/// new one must be recorded.
